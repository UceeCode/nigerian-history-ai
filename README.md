# Nigerian History AI Assistant

---

## üìö Project Overview

The **Nigerian History AI Assistant** is an intelligent AI companion dedicated to answering questions about Nigeria's rich and complex history. Leveraging a sophisticated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, this system combines the power of a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM) with a knowledge base derived from various Nigerian historical sources. It's designed to provide accurate, context-aware, and cited responses, ensuring historical fidelity and user trust.

The project encompasses a full-stack architecture: a robust Python backend handling data processing, RAG orchestration, and API services, complemented by a beautiful, Nigerian-themed Next.js frontend for an intuitive user experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Contextual Q&A:** Get precise answers to inquiries based on an extensive knowledge base of Nigerian history, extracted from diverse sources like academic papers, historical documents, and reputable websites.
* **Comprehensive Data Collection:** Web scraping and PDF text extraction process gathers raw historical data.
* **Intelligent Data Preprocessing:** Raw data is retrieved from MongoDB, cleaned, chunked, filtered for quality, and then embedded into a FAISS vector store, optimizing it for retrieval.
* **RAG Pipeline:** Integrates a FAISS vector store with a powerful open-source LLM (Llama 3.2:1b via Ollama) to generate highly relevant and informed responses.
* **Real-time Streaming Responses:** Enjoy a dynamic chat experience as AI answers are streamed character-by-character to the frontend, mimicking a natural conversation flow.
* **API Accessibility:** The core AI functionalities are exposed via a FastAPI backend, allowing for flexible integration.
* **Beautiful UI:** An intuitive and visually appealing user interface built with Next.js, featuring a vibrant Nigerian color theme for an immersive experience.
